# Operating-System
Operating System Design (Java)


Project Overview

The project for this course is to build an operating system from scratch. 
We believe that the best way to learn about operating systems is to build one yourself. Thus, you will be building most parts of a small operating system. To ease your task, we will give you a bare-bones but functional operating system called Nachos. Your task is to extend Nachos's functionality and improve its performance.

The project has four phases, corresponding to four of the major pieces of a modern operating system: thread management, multiprogramming, virtual memory, and networking. Due to time constraints you are asked to build only first two phases.

Some phases build on previous phases; for example, all parts of the project use thread management routines.
